My solutions to the 2015 advent of code challenges as seen on this site: https://adventofcode.com/2015

# Problem 1a and 1b:
Fun to learn how to read in large text input in Rust. The referencing got me at first coming from Python, but it was easy enough to figure out with a quick google.  
1a -> Trick for me, using a Hashmap as a count vs iterating and adding. I wanted to practice some data structures and this was a fun way.  
1b -> Remember kids, if you start at 0, the actual spot is + 1. Basic mistake but nearly got me in smaller test cases.
